This is a step by step guide to install and run an ssh server on an android pc required
Remember you can't do this if you do not have the ip of the device witch you can find the ip
by going to the following link https://ipinfo.io/ or https://www.ipchicken.com/

1. Go here https://apkpure.com/termux/com.termux/

2. We can also run this adb install ~/Downloads/Termux_v0.73_apkpure.com.apk

3. Now in the termux application run these commands as followed

4. pkg install tsu

5. pkg install root-repo

6. pkg install update

7. pkg install grade

8. pkg install openssh

9. Now, set a password for the current user by running passwd, remember this password you will need it later

10. Then, Start the SSH server inside by running sshd, do not close/exit the app after running the command

11. On the pc terminal run the following, dont use root@ as prefix to the ip address

12. ssh <ip address of android device> -p 8022

13. When asked for password, enter the password you used in the steps above
This will drop you into a shell where you can do further installs using pkg install <name> or run any other command you would like wget, curl you get a proper linux shell, sweet, enjoy!

14. Host key verification error
If for some odd reason you are getting Host key verification failed error, run the following first
ssh-keygen -R <ip address of android device>
If it still gives you trouble edit ~/.ssh/known_hosts, locate the line(s) with the ip address and delete it and then connect again
Waiting forever to connect
There are instances when the pc to android ip connection will wait a long time. If so, first check if you can ping the android's ip address, and if its not pingable, perhaps reboot the android device. Stating the obvious here, unless the android cant be pinged you cant ssh into it.
